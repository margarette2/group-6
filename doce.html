In Senior High School we've to choose one strand. Each student can choose in five different strand: 
Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), 
Humanities and Social Science (HUMSS), Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Track (TVL), and General Academic Strand (GAS). 
It provides knowledge for your upcoming course on college. </p>

The strand that we'll choose will help us to focus on the things that are related to the course that we'll take in college. 
It builds a better understanding of the courses that we'll take in college.

with courses not traditionally available within our Program's general offerings. </p>
